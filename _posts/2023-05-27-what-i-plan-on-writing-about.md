Welcome to my website and my first blog post! I don't know exactly what I'm going to be writing about in the future, I just know that as of late I've developed an urge to get things off my mind and this will be my platform to do that. Hopefully some of it will be it useful to you, reader. If not useful then perhaps relatable. If not relatable then maybe at least interesting to get an insight into the psyche of a random person. Worst case, I'm pretty sure writing posts will act as a sort of journalling exercise for me and will help me clear my head and understand the decisions I make.
